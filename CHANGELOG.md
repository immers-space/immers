2.1.1
* Fix issue with federated delivery not resuming after migration

2.1.0 nodeinfo and proxy services
* Update stale dependencies and resolve most audit issues
* Finally on to Parcel v2 (had to change out the HTML sanitizer for it to work)
* New federation feature: nodeinfo standard is implemented to allow discovery of server and features from other servers/crawlers
* New features: proxy services. Both the ActivityPub standard POST proxy (for AP objects) and a more general GET proxy to help with CORS
* **Migration**: update actor's `endpoints` with `proxyURl` and `OAuthAuthorization`; `streams` with `blocklist`
